# Super_ressolution_GAN
### Custom dataset loader and dataset processing, custom models and improved MSE Loss with Sobel operator<br/>

Work still in progress<br/>

Neural network trained for upscaling images<br/>
Result of my test model, without validate set used for saving model<br/>
Right now training of 8x upsample is in progress<br/>
